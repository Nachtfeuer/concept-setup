# Welcome to the concept-setup Docker page

= Introduction =

Docker is a mechanism to run a process isolated in
a defined environment and can be used also to deploy
a container to another machine. I'm using that for
a ci/cd pipeline for following setups:

 - building war file (Java 8, Maven 3)
 - building UI static files (nodejs, bower, ...)
 - building C++ application and RPM for it (gcc >= 4.9.x, CMake >= 3.3)

Also the build slave might be a different OS you
can organize to build on CentOS 7.x (as example) which
is preferable the same (nearly) environment as in production.

= Quick start =

 * Running a CentOS 7 bash environment:
   {{docker run --name=dev -it centos:7.2.1511 bash}}
 * Running a CentOS 7 bash environment
   mounting current path as /docker inside the container:
   {{docker run --name=dev -v $PWD:/docker -it centos:7.2.1511 bash}}
