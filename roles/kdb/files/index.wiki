# Welcome to concept-setup environment

The idea of that environment is to create and
to adjust it via *Ansible*. Of course you could
modify this wiki pages but finally you should
update the Git repository. *The backup is Git*.

The following aspects are handled
by the concept-setup playbook:

 * Installation of commandline tools like Git, ag, Vim, ctags, ...
 * User specific configuration for Git, Vim, ...
 * Providing a knowledge database (this wiki, vim notes, ...)
 * Providing some useful scripts.

Here now the links to the sub pages:
